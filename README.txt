## Real Estate Analysis

The aim of this is to fetch data from a real estate website and save it into a parquet file. Pyspark is then used to study the data. Finally, we create a user-friendly dashboard with Streamlit for easier data exploration.


#NOTE
These notebooks should be ran (particularly 'preprocessing_feature_engineering.ipnyb') on a computer with Java (because of use of pyspark)
